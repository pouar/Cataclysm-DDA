# Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead: Diaperfur Edition
Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a roguelike set in a post-apocalyptic world. While some have described it as a "zombie game", there is far more to Cataclysm than that. Struggle to survive in a harsh, persistent, procedurally generated world. Scavenge the remnants of a dead civilization for food, equipment, or, if you are lucky, a vehicle with a full tank of gas to get you the hell out of Dodge. Fight to defeat or escape from a wide variety of powerful monstrosities, from zombies to giant insects to killer robots and things far stranger and deadlier, and against the others like yourself, that want what you have...


### This is a modified version of DDA with my own changes, Including diapers,playing as an anthromorphic dragon, a new bladder hidden stat, and a ton of other stuff. I originally wasn't going to release this to the public but since some people might want this I decided to upload it anyway.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Is there a tutorial?

Yes, you can find the tutorial in the **Special** menu at the main menu. You can also access documentation in-game via the **?** key.

#### How can I change the key bindings?

Press the `?` key, followed by the `1` key to see the full list of key commands. Press the `+` key to add a key binding, select which action with the corresponding letter key `a-w`, and then the key you wish to assign to that action.

## Changes
to see what changes I made, checkout both the master and diaperfur branch, makes sure both branches are up to date with "git pull" then run "git diff master..diaperfur"

Also, It seems I diverged enough from the original that the saves are no longer compatible with the original. Probably a good idea to have a seperate world.
