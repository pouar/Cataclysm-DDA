Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead: Diaperfur Edition

Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a roguelike set in a post-apocalyptic world. While some have described it as a "zombie game", there is far more to Cataclysm than that. Struggle to survive in a harsh, persistent, procedurally generated world. Scavenge the remnants of a dead civilization for food, equipment, or, if you are lucky, a vehicle with a full tank of gas to get you the hell out of Dodge. Fight to defeat or escape from a wide variety of powerful monstrosities, from zombies to giant insects to killer robots and things far stranger and deadlier, and against the others like yourself, that want what you have...


This is a modified version of DDA with my own changes, Including diapers,playing as an anthromorphic dragon, a new bladder hidden stat, and a ton of other stuff. I originally wasn't going to release this to the public but since some people might want this I decided to upload it anyway.


Compile
The latest instructions on how to compile can be found on [the CDDA wiki](http://www.wiki.cataclysmdda.com/index.php?title=How_to_compile).  See doc/COMPILER_SUPPORT.md for details on which compilers CDDA supports.

Changes
to see what changes I made, checkout both the master and diaperfur branch, makes sure both branches are up to date with "git pull" then run "git diff master..diaperfur"

Also, It seems I diverged enough from the original that the saves are no longer compatible with the original. Probably a good idea to have a seperate world.

Since a bug may be my fault and not an upstream issue, report it to https://thepouar.dnsdojo.com/bugzilla first.
